# Simple Socket Communication with Protocol Buffers

## Purpose
This project demonstrates simple client-server communication using Java's `SocketServer` and `Socket` classes. It utilizes a custom protocol defined with Protocol Buffers (protobuf). The client reads a JSON file, creates a protobuf object, sends it to the server, and receives the calculated result. The server responds with a protobuf message containing the result.

For protocol details, please refer to the `.proto` file located in the default `src/main/proto` directory. The Gradle build system is set up to compile the protobuf files.

## How to Run
1. Compile the protobuf file:
   ```sh
   gradle generateProto

2. Run the server:
   ```sh
   gradle runServer

3. Run the client:
   ```sh
   gradle runClient or gradle runClient -Pport=9099 -Phost='localhost'


## Protocol

*Note:* **CL == client, SV == server**

## Logging In

1. **Logging In (Client Interaction):**
   - The client initiates the login process by sending a request with their name.
     - Request Type: `NAME`
     - Required Fields: `name`

2. **Logging In (Server Interaction):**
   - The server responds to the client's login request with a greeting message.
     - Response Type: `HELLO`
     - Required Fields: `message` (a greeting message to the client)

## Viewing Leaderboard

1. **Viewing Leaderboard (Client Interaction):**
   - The client can request the leaderboard to view past players' scores.
     - Request Type: `LEADERBOARD`
     - Required Fields: None

2. **Viewing Leaderboard (Server Interaction):**
   - The server responds with a list of past players and their scores.
     - Response Type: `LEADERBOARD`
     - Required Fields: `leaderboard` (a repeated field including everyone on the leaderboard)

## Playing the Game

1. **Playing the Game (Client Interaction):**
   - The client initiates the game by requesting a new game to be started or joined.
     - Request Type: `NEW`
     - Required Fields: None

2. **Playing the Game (Server Interaction - Starting a New Game):**
   - The server responds to the client's request, specifying if the game is joined or started.
     - Response Type: `TASK`
     - Required Fields: `image`, `task`

3. **Playing the Game (Client Interaction - Sending an Answer):**
   - While in the game, the client can send an answer to the server.
     - Request Type: `ANSWER`
     - Required Fields: `answer`

4. **Playing the Game (Server Interaction - Game Not Yet Won):**
   - If the game is not yet won, the server replies with another task.
     - Response Type: `TASK`
     - Required Fields: `image`, `task`, `eval` (where `eval` is either `true` or `false`).
       - If `eval` is `false`, the task will be the same as the previous one.

5. **Playing the Game (Server Interaction - Game Won):**
   - If the game is won, the server sends the current finished image and a message indicating the game has been won.
     - Response Type: `WON`
     - Required Fields: `image`, `message` (a winning comment).

## Quitting the Game

1. **Quitting the Game (Client Interaction):**
   - The client can quit the game by sending a request.
     - Request Type: `QUIT`
     - Required Fields: None

2. **Quitting the Game (Server Interaction):**
   - The server responds with a message including a goodbye message.
     - Response Type: `BYE`
     - Required Fields: `message` (a goodbye message).

## Handling Errors

- Errors can be generated by malformed or unexpected requests. The client is responsible for keeping track of the state to continue.

Error Response (Server Interaction):
- Response Type: `ERROR`
- Required Fields: `message` (description of the error), `type` (error type).
   - Error Types:
     - `1` - Required field missing (the message should name the missing field).
     - `2` - Request not supported (the message should name the unsupported request).
     - `0` - Any other errors (in this case, the message will just be displayed).

## How to Work with the Program

To work with the program, follow these general steps:

1. Start the server on a specified port using the `runServer` Gradle task.
2. Start the client and connect to the server by providing the server's hostname and port using the `runClient` Gradle task.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to log in, view the leaderboard, start or join a game, answer tasks, and quit the game.
4. Pay attention to error messages from the server and handle them accordingly.

The client and server components interact according to the defined protocol, allowing players to participate in the game, view scores, and enjoy the gaming experience.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed and the Gradle tasks configured as mentioned in the provided `build.gradle` file. You can customize the client's inputs and play the game based on your interactions with the server.
